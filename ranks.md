Those performing at the Ronin rank should be familiar with basic OSINT techniques and terms, and should be comfortable with searching for solutions to anything that they do not immediately understand. Users in this level will see their challenges increase slighty and they will be expected to perform at a slightly higher level than they did in the Student rank. Challenges in this level shift from simply trying different challenges, to preforming them successfully. Similar to the Student rank, challenges in the Ronin level heavily revolve around performing simple OSINT challenges and then using that experience to provide video or written products. Users must spend a minimum of 1 month in the Student level before applying for the Ronin rank.<br><br>

In order to obtain this rank, you must send an email to the OSINT Dojo with proof that you have completed all of the Rank Requirements listed below. You may only use work completed while holding the Student level to meet the challenge requirements for this rank. Be sure to send the email using the email you would like the Badgr badge to be issued to.<br> <br>

  document.getElementById("chosenrank").innerHTML =`<h3>Rank Description</h3>The third rank in the OSINT Dojo is Samurai. Users at this level should be familiar with many OSINT techniques, methodologies, and platforms, and may even already have a specialization in one or more areas. Those that reach this level will continue to hone their OSINT skills introduced in the Student and Ronin stages, while reducing their reliance on OSINT challenges as prompts for video or written challenges. The video and written challenges will also increase in length and users are expected to judge or provide some other form of volunteer assistance for an OSINT CTF to gain experience and learn how others perform the same OSINT tasks, though often using different techniques and methodologies. Users must spend a minimum of 2 months in the Ronin level before applying for the Samurai rank.<br><br>
