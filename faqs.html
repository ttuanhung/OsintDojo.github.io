      <h3>What is the OSINT Dojo?</h3>
<p>The OSINT Dojo is a side project that attempts to gamify the OSINT learning process. We aim to provide a clear set of goals and objectives to achieve in order to guide new OSINT analysts through their OSINT journey.  These objectives are designed to teach common processes, collaboration, and encourage the growth of an analyst’s OSINT skillsets. We also provide digital badges to help track your progress and show off to your friends!</p>

<h3>How much is it?</h3>
<p>The OSINT Dojo will cost you nothing but time and energy. </p>

<h3>How do I participate?</h3>
<p><b>To get started:</b> In order to get started, you must first earn the rank of OSINT student. Once you’ve successfully completed all of the rank requirements found here, please reach out to the OSINT Dojo and submit your required documentation using the email you would like the badge to be awarded to. After we check everything out and verify your submission, we’ll submit you for your first badge!</p>

<p><b>To rank up:</b> Each level within the OSINT Dojo contains a list of requirements needed in order to achieve that level and obtain the associated badge. In order to achieve the next rank, you must successfully complete all of the rank requirements and submit proof of completion to the OSINT Dojo via email. Also make sure that you have spent the minimum amount of time in your current level before submitting your documentation to rank up to the next level. </p>

<h3>What data do you collect?</h3>
<p>In order to award your badge, the OSINT Dojo will need you to provide the email address you want the Badgr badge sent over to. We ask that you sent your rank up requests using the email in which you would like to have the Badgr badge awarded to. </p>
