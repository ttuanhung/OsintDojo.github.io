  Hello and welcome to the OSINT Dojo! The OSINT Dojo is a project that aims to guide those new to Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) through the first steps of their OSINT journey.
  
  This is done through a number of challenges designed to build investigative, writing, and verbal presentation skills. As you complete each set of requirements, you will increase your OSINT Dojo rank and earn badges in the process.
